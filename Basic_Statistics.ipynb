    "1) Symmetry: The normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical around its mean. This means that the left side of the curve mirrors the right side, and deviations from the mean are equally likely in both directions.\n",

    "3) Bell-Shaped Curve: The graphical representation of a normal distribution is bell-shaped, tapering off symmetrically towards both ends (the tails). This shape reflects the probability density function of the distribution.\n",
    "4) Total Area Under the Curve: The total area under the normal distribution curve equals 1, representing the total probability of all possible outcomes.\n",
    "5) Asymptotic Nature: The tails of the normal distribution approach but never touch the horizontal axis. This means that there is always a non-zero probability of extreme values occurring, although they become increasingly rare.\n",
    "6) Defined by Mean and Standard Deviation: The normal distribution is fully described by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). The mean determines the location of the center of the graph, while the standard deviation controls the spread or width of the distribution:\n",
    "A smaller standard deviation results in a steeper curve.\n",
    "A larger standard deviation produces a flatter curve.\n",

    "A random variable is a mathematical function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of a random experiment. It serves as a way to quantify the outcomes of random phenomena, making it easier to analyze and interpret uncertainty in various contexts. Random variables can take on different values based on the results of the experiment, and they are typically denoted by capital letters such as \n",

    "A discrete random variable can take on a countable number of distinct values. These values are often specific outcomes of an experiment. For instance:\n",

    "The height of individuals in a population can vary continuously within a range.\n",
